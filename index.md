# My First Project
##13th Mar.
Last year, I was a newbie in the SQL, R. I am slowly self-learning.Due to the pressure of promotion, I need some SCI articles. One of the shortcuts is big data research.
Now I have started my project for e-ICU database, thanks to the code contributors on github, I will share my code here after my submit.
