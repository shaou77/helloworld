Last year, I was a newbie in the SQL and R. I am slowly learning by myself.Due to the pressure of promotion, I need some SCI articles. <br>
One of the shortcuts is big data research.Now I have started my project for e-ICU database, thanks to the code contributors on github, I will share my code here after my submit.

The statistics of my first project encountered a problem and I had to start the second project. But after a class, I want to start the third project, a meta-analysis, I still want to start machine learning, but I have no time.
